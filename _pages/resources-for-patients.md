    What is International Patient Access?

    [International Patient Access (IPA)](/what-is-patient-access/){: target="_blank"} enables you to easily and securely access your health data across different healthcare systems and countries, much like how you would manage your bank accounts through online banking. This access is made possible by adhering to the HL7 FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) standard, which ensures data is shared in a secure and standardized way.

    Benefits of Accessing Your Healthcare Data:

    - Empowerment and Control: By having access to your health data, you can make informed decisions about your care and treatment options. This empowers you to be an active participant in your healthcare journey.

    - Improved Care Coordination: With your data readily available, healthcare providers can better coordinate your care, leading to improved outcomes and a more streamlined healthcare experience.

    - Access Anywhere, Anytime: Regardless of where you are in the world, you can access your vital health information, ensuring you receive accurate and timely care when traveling or relocating.

    - Privacy and Security: The use of international standards like HL7 FHIR ensures that your health data is shared securely, protecting your privacy while allowing necessary access for healthcare providers.

    How to Get Started

    1. Talk to Your Healthcare Provider: Ask if they are using IPA-enabled systems and how you can access your health records.
    2. Use Secure Health Portals: Many healthcare providers offer patient portals where you can safely view your medical records, test results, treatment plans and connect this data to other apps.
    3. Stay Informed: Follow updates to health data access to ensure you're aware of your options.
