# The kind of Markdown processor used by Jekyll is called Kramdown. Kramdown allows you to use HTML tags in your Markdown files.
# The following code is an example of how to use HTML tags in Markdown files.
#
# To do this, you need to use the following syntax:
# Text content goes on one line, the curly brackets {: } on the other
# {: .css-class html_attribute="false"}
# Output: <p class="css-class" html_attribute="false">Text content goes on one line</p>

# Images and links put the special curly brackets on the same line as the Markdown content
# ![Image alt text](/path/to/image){: .css-class width="300px"}
# Output: <img src="/path/to/image" alt="Image alt text" class="css-class" width="300px">
