    **Resources:**

    - Successfully engaging individuals in digital health requires effort in areas such as governance, consumer digital literacy, individual enrollment, health record integration as well as the technical patient access enabled by IPA. The Global Digital Health Partnership’s [International Insights on Individual Engagement](https://gdhp.health/international-insights-on-individual-engagement/){: target="_blank"} contains a survey of efforts across the globe.
    - The [2024 State of FHIR Adoption Survey](https://interop.esante.gouv.fr/ig/doctrine/0.1.0-ballot/2024%20StateofFHIRSurveyResults_final.pdf){: target="_blank"} report summarizes and analyzes the use of HL7 FHIR across 29 countries.
    - The [WHO’s National eHealth Strategy Toolkit](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/national-ehealth-strategy-toolkit){: target="blank"} may help jurisdictions develop and implement an eHealth strategy, including enabling greater digital patient access.
    - The [Global Digital Health Monitor](https://monitor.digitalhealthmonitor.org/map){: target="blank"} provides potentially useful indicators for national digital health maturity.
    
    The below Request For Proposal can be used as a starting place to ensure that enterprise health it software supports IPA by HL7 FHIR as part of the tender process.
