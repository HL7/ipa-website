International Patient Access (IPA) is a FHIR implementation guide that attempts to establish a universal/global set of requirements for FHIR servers and apps that nations can use to kickstart the ability for their citizens to access their health information via APIs.

# IPA Organization Directory

This repository includes a public directory of organizations that host a FHIR server enabling patient access (among other use-cases) conformant to the [International Patient Access FHIR Implementation Guide](https://hl7.org/fhir/uv/ipa/).
The directory is represented in the [organizations.json file](directory-documentation/organizations.json). The organizations file is a simple listing of organization name, website, type, location, FHIR server url, and a reference to a successful Inferno IPA test.  This information is used for purposes of verification and display. Additional information about the fields in the directory file is available in [organizations-metadata.md](directory-documentation/organizations-metadata.md).


# IPA App Directory

This repository includes a public directory of patient-facing software applications ("apps") that adhere to the [International Patient Access FHIR Implementation Guide](https://hl7.org/fhir/uv/ipa/). The directory is represented in the [apps.json file](directory-documentation/apps.json).The apps file is a simple listing of patient-facing application developers and products. This information is used for purposes of verification and display.  Additional information about the fields in the directory file is available in [apps-metadata.json](directory-documentation/apps-metadata.json).

## Requirements for Organizations
### Types of Organizations
Today, the types of organizations permitted in the IPA Organization Directory are limited to the following:

- clinical health systems and hospitals providing patient care
- national and regional pharmacy chains
- national and regional laboratory diagnostics providers
- national and regional health insurance payors
- government and governmental agencies. 

Participation is currently limited to these issuers because itâ€™s easier for website visitors to understand who these organizations are and how they work, to understand where data originate and are held, and to audit if issues arise. 

### Technical Requirements
Organizations and Apps must follow the [International Patient Access FHIR Implementation Guide](https://hl7.org/fhir/uv/ipa/). The minimum requirements to comply to the specification are support for: 
* the [IPA Patient Profile](https://hl7.org/fhir/uv/ipa/StructureDefinition-ipa-patient.html),
* at least one other [additional IPA Profile](https://hl7.org/fhir/uv/ipa/artifacts.html#profiles-primary-resources),
* the IPA required (SHALL) [search parameters for the profiles you support](https://hl7.org/fhir/uv/ipa/CapabilityStatement-ipa-server.html#Patient1-9),
* and the required (SHALL) [SMART on FHIR Capabilities](https://hl7.org/fhir/uv/ipa/access.html#smart-on-fhir-server-capabilities)."


### Getting Listed
The HL7 IPA Project reviews each submission, verifies information contained in the submission, and performs technical validation. In the event that a submission requires subjective evaluation, the HL7 Patient Care Workgroup may be consulted for resolution.
